        <h1>Welcome to the Future of Computers</h1>
    </header>
    <section id="future-of-computers">
        <h2>1. Super Smart Computers (Artificial Intelligence - AI)</h2>
        <p>📌 <strong>What is it?</strong></p>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is when computers learn and think like humans. AI helps computers recognize voices, answer questions, and even make decisions!</p>
        
        <p>🤖 <strong>How will AI help in the future?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Talking Computers: Computers will talk like real people, helping with homework and answering questions.</li>
            <li>Smart Tutors: AI can teach kids by understanding what they need to learn and explaining it better.</li>
            <li>Helpful Robots: AI-powered robots will do chores, assist in hospitals, and even drive cars!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>🌟 <strong>Fun Example:</strong></p>
        <p>Imagine having a robot friend who plays games with you, helps with studies, and tells jokes!</p>
        
        <h2>2. Super Fast Quantum Computers</h2>
        <p>📌 <strong>What is it?</strong></p>
        <p>Most computers today work with 0s and 1s (binary code). But Quantum Computers use special particles to solve problems millions of times faster!</p>
        
        <p>🚀 <strong>How will they help in the future?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Super-Fast Problem Solving: Scientists will solve medical, space, and climate problems much quicker.</li>
            <li>Better Video Games & Movies: Quantum computers will create more realistic worlds in games and animations.</li>
            <li>Safer Internet: They will make online banking and passwords super secure from hackers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>🌟 <strong>Fun Example:</strong></p>
        <p>A quantum computer could solve a giant maze in seconds, while today’s computers might take years!</p>
        
        <h2>3. Robots and Smart Machines</h2>
        <p>📌 <strong>What is it?</strong></p>
        <p>Robots are machines that can do tasks by themselves. In the future, they will become more advanced and help in everyday life!</p>
        
        <p>🤖 <strong>How will robots change the world?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>House Robots: Machines will help clean rooms, cook food, and do homework.</li>
            <li>Hospital Robots: Doctors will use robots for surgeries and taking care of patients.</li>
            <li>Space Robots: NASA will send robot explorers to other planets to study them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>🌟 <strong>Fun Example:</strong></p>
        <p>Imagine having a robot pet that plays with you, talks, and never gets tired! 🐶🤖</p>
        
        <h2>4. Virtual Reality (VR) and Holograms</h2>
        <p>📌 <strong>What is it?</strong></p>
        <p>Virtual Reality (VR) and holograms create 3D worlds that you can explore using special glasses or devices.</p>
        
        <p>🎮 <strong>How will VR & Holograms change the future?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>School Trips from Home: Students can visit the Egyptian pyramids or Mars without leaving the classroom!</li>
            <li>Gaming Fun: Games will feel real, where you can move, jump, and interact with everything inside them.</li>
            <li>Virtual Shopping: Instead of going to a store, you can try on clothes inside a VR store!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>🌟 <strong>Fun Example:</strong></p>
        <p>Imagine wearing VR glasses and feeling like you're inside a game, running through a magical jungle! 🕶️🌿</p>
        
        <h2>5. Eco-Friendly and Energy-Saving Computers</h2>
        <p>📌 <strong>What is it?</strong></p>
        <p>Future computers will use less electricity and be better for the planet by running on solar power and recycled materials.</p>
        
        <p>🌎 <strong>How will they help the Earth?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Less Waste: Computers will be made from eco-friendly materials that don’t harm nature.</li>
            <li>Solar-Powered Devices: Laptops and tablets will charge using sunlight instead of wires!</li>
            <li>Longer Battery Life: Devices will last longer without needing frequent charging.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>🌟 <strong>Fun Example:</strong></p>
        <p>Imagine a solar-powered laptop that never runs out of battery while you play outside! ☀️💻</p>
